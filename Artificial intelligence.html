	<h2 align="Center"><I>Artificial Intelligence or AI is the upcoming future of the world. It is the wide ranging branch of computer science which helps in building smart machines which are capable of performing the tasks which were earlier done by humans. The basic work of Artificial Intelligence is to make the work done by humans easier.<P>
It could perform various tasks such as problem solving, decision making, perception, understanding human communication. AI has several advantages. It causes less error in the programs, apps, calculations that we perform. It is always there to help us and whereas a normal human can perform his/her work till 4 to 6 hours a machine could perform the same task unendingly and faster than a human. Digital Assistance is used by several organizations to reduce the use of human resources and it also saves there time. Some Digital systems are designed in such a way that it becomes difficult for one to identify whether he was talking to a human or a chatbot. AI always makes it decisions faster. For example if we play a game of chess with a computer we would find that the computer would quickly move it’s pieces while human keeps on thinking what to do next. Artificial Intelligence has also reached to our homes and even in our mobiles and laptop/computers. For example one only says “okay Google” and his command and our smart phones will quickly trigger the assistant and it would fulfill our command.<P>
Although Artificial Intelligence is our mate but it has various adversities. AI has high cost for its creation and its software and hardware need to be updated every day to meet the latest requirements. AI also makes the humans lazy with its applications. And humans get addicted to this ease and this laziness can cause hazard to the future generations. Due to Artificial Intelligence many companies or organizations are reducing their workers and are switching to computerized machines. Unlike humans AI does not have any feeling or emotion. It cannot develop a bond with humans when it comes to Team Management. Machines can only perform tasks which are programmed in them whereas humans can use their brains to think out of the box and creative.<P>
AI and humans could become best friends in the future if they work together and humans do not get addicted and become lazy. AI could help break through the boundaries which we cannot conceive even right now. All world systems, networks, mobility, collaboration and security needs to work together seamlessly to protect the human race and humans do not become the slave of Artificial Intelligence.<P>
